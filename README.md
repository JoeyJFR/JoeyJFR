Hi, Iâ€™m Joey ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about technology and innovation since childhood, with a lifelong enthusiasm for video games and problem-solving.

After several years as a physiotherapist helping patients recover through data-driven methods, I decided to redirect my career toward programming.

I am currently studying at 42 Lyon since November 2024, developing expertise in C/C++, algorithms, and system programming, with a strong interest in data analysis, AI, and game development.

I am motivated to create technology that improves peopleâ€™s lives and bridges healthcare and intelligent systems.
