# Hi, I‚Äôm Joey üëã

I‚Äôve been passionate about technology and innovation since childhood ‚Äî always fascinated by how games and systems work behind the scenes.  

After several years working as a **physiotherapist**, where I helped patients recover using **data-driven methods**, I decided to redirect my career toward **programming** to create technology that improves people‚Äôs lives.  

I‚Äôm currently studying at **42 Lyon** (since November 2024), developing expertise in **C/C++**, **algorithms**, and **system programming**, with growing interests in **data analysis**, **AI**, and **game development**.

### üß† My Focus
- Writing efficient and reliable low-level code in C and C++  
- Building robust backend and system-level applications (HTTP servers, shells, containers)  
- Exploring how technology can connect **healthcare** and **intelligent systems**
